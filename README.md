# lcd-v2-data

**lcd-v2-data** is a Python toolkit for downloading and processing [Local Climatological Data version 2 (LCDv2) ](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/local-climatological-data) data.

It provides:

- A top-level command-line tool that
  
  - automates the download of LCD v2 station observations for
    - individual stations
    - U.S. states and territories
    - Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) / Independent System Operator (ISO) regions
    
  - constructs full-hourly UTC time series of
    - temperature at 2 m
    - dew point temperature at 2 m
    - relative humidity at 2 m
    - wind speed at 10 m
  
    from the irregularly spaced, local time LCD v2 station observation time series, for a selected station or for stations in the selected U.S. state/territory or RTO/ISO region, and a user-specified time range. The time series are saved in a netCDF file.  
    
- Modules for downloading and processing LCD v2 station observations.

LCD v2 is provided by the [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/).

## Installation

```bash
mamba install -c jan.kazil -c conda-forge lcd-v2-data
```

## Overview

The package provides a command-line tool that selects stations by geography (a single station by GHCNh identifier, a U.S. state or territory, RTO/ISO regions, and the special region CONUS representing the contiguous U.S.), checks data availability, downloads LCD v2 observation files for a given year range, constructs full-hourly UTC time series for the observables, and saves them in a NetCDF file. It optionally generates plots showing the original and the interpolated time series.

Geospatial region selection is based on U.S. Energy Information Administration definitions of RTO/ISO footprints, and U.S. Census Bureau state/territory boundaries, included with the package.

The list of GHCNh station identifiers is available [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/hourly/doc/ghcnh-station-list.txt). LCD v2 contains only U.S. stations.

## Workflow

The following describes the internal workflow performed by the command-line tool:

1. Load the region geometry (RTO/ISO polygons or U.S. state/territory boundaries) if a region is specified; skip this step if a station ID is provided.
2. Retrieve the station list from NCEI and either filter it spatially by region or select the specified station.
3. Filter the stations by data availability for the requested year range, either online by probing NCEI or offline by checking local files.
4. Save the filtered station list for reference.
5. Download LCD v2 observation files from NCEI for the selected stations and years, skipping files already present that match by ETag.
6. Create full-hourly UTC time series for temperature (T), dew point temperature (Td), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed by converting local observation time to UTC and interpolating the data to full hours. Remove temperatures above 60 °C. Perform interpolation only across gaps of up to 2 hours. Derive RH from T and Td.
7. Optionally create comparison plots for the original and interpolated series.
8. Save the full-hourly UTC time series in a NetCDF file, for the given station or the stations in the state/region.

**Notes:** Interpolation of station observation time series across many years and/or many stations can be slow due to inherent limitations of Python. Creating plots is very slow and recommended only for individual stations (as opposed to regions).

## Command-line interface (CLI)

The CLI is exposed as `"build-lcd-dataset"` when installed.

**Usage:**

```bash
build-lcd-dataset START_YEAR END_YEAR REGION DATA_DIR [-n N_JOBS] [-o] [-p PLOT_DIR] [-r] [-v]
```

**Positional arguments**  

- `START_YEAR` and `END_YEAR`: Inclusive range of years  
- `REGION`: Region or station selector. Use a two-letter U.S. state or territory code, `'CONUS'`, one of the RTO/ISO codes, or a GHCNh station identifier  
- `DATA_DIR`: Directory into which data will be downloaded  

**Options**  

- `-n, --n N_JOBS`: Number of parallel download processes. Values greater than 1 accelerate downloads but may increase the risk of network errors.  
- `-o, --offline`: Work offline. All required files must have been downloaded to `DATA_DIR` in a previous call without this flag.  
- `-p, --plotdir PLOT_DIR`: Directory where plots of the original and interpolated full-hourly time series will be created. Very slow. If omitted, no plots are generated.  
- `-r, --refresh`: Download and process files even if they already exist in `DATA_DIR`.  
- `-v, --verbose`: Print progress information.  

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show usage information, valid region codes, and RTO/ISO region names:
build-lcd-dataset --help

# Download LCDv2 data and build a dataset as a NetCDF file for station USW00003017 for the years 2020–2025, 
# in the directory /path/to/data, and create plots in /path/to/plots:
build-lcd-dataset 2020 2025 USW00003017 /path/to/data -p /path/to/plots

# Download LCDv2 data and build a dataset as a NetCDF file for the RTO region ERCOT for the year 2022 
# in the directory /path/to/data, using 32 parallel download processes:
build-lcd-dataset 2022 2022 ERCOT /path/to/data -n 32

# Build a dataset as a NetCDF file for the state of Colorado for the year 2021, offline from data 
# previously downloaded to /path/to/data:
build-lcd-dataset 2021 2021 CO /path/to/data --offline
```

## Public API

## Development

### Code Quality and Testing Commands

- `make fmt` - Runs ruff format, which automatically reformats Python files according to the style rules in `pyproject.toml`
- `make lint` - Runs ruff check - -fix, which lints the code (checks for style errors, bugs, outdated patterns, etc.) and auto-fixes what it can.
- `make check` - Runs fmt and lint.
- `make type` - Currently disabled. Runs mypy, the static type checker, using the strictness settings from `pyproject.toml`. Mypy is a static type checker for Python, a dynamically typed language. Because static analysis cannot account for all dynamic runtime behaviors, mypy may report false positives which do not reflect actual runtime issues.
- `make test` - Runs pytest with reporting (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
